# Sketches

This project studies the usage of sketches and estimators for network telemetry and neural networks.
The project includes efficient Python implementations of the following counters: [Morris](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/reading/morris.pdf), CEDAR, [SEAD](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9537736), [AEE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340859493_Faster_and_More_Accurate_Measurement_through_Additive-Error_Counters).
The project provides also Python impelemntation of [Count Min Sketch](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196677403001913} and [Space Saving Cache](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/comp5331/References/EfficientComputationOfFrequentAndTop-kElementsInDataStreams.pdf).

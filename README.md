# Sketches

This project studies the usage of sketches and estimators for network telemetry and neural networks.
The project includes Python implementation of various sketch and esimation schemes, such as Morris Counters, CEDAR, SEAD, and Count Min Sketch.
As the research is still in preliminary stage, the code is not fully debugged yet.
A recommended reading For further details about sketches is
